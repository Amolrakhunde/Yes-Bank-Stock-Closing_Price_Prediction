# Yes-Bank-Stock-Prediction
## Yes-Bank-Stock-Closing-Price-Prediction - Capstone Project
## Problem Statement:

Yes Bank is a well-known bank in the Indian financial domain. Since 2018, it has been in the news because of the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor. Owing to this fact, it was interesting to see how that impacted the stock prices of the company and whether Time series models or any other predictive models can do justice to such situations. This dataset has monthly stock prices of the bank since its inception and includes closing, starting, highest, and lowest stock prices of every month. The main objective is to predict the stockâ€™s closing price of the month.

## Data Features:-

Combined Comparison of Model

## Conclusion:-

1. Maximum accuracy of 82% achieved.

2. Linear, lasso and ridge regression show almost same R squared values.

3. Whereas elastic net model shows lowest R squared value and high MSE, RMSE, MAE & MAPE.

4. Close, Open and high price of stock are strongly correlated with each other.
